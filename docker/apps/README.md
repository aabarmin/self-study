# Docker Apps

This project is a collection of useful applications that can make your life easier. All
of them could be started from Gradle or manually. 

In order to start the app using Gradle go to the necessary folder and execute the following
command:

```shell script
$ gradle composeUp
```

If you prefer using a plain command line, the same result could be achieved using the following
command:

```shell script
$ docker-compose up
```
